#Commercial Solar Financing Options

Businesses are considering solar power to reduce energy costs and enhance their environmental
footprint. The right choice can lead to significant savings and a healthier bottom line.


Equipment Loans
How They Operate
Equipment loans allow businesses to financially support the purchase of solar panel systems,
which involves borrowing a lump sum that is repaid over a fixed term with interest.


Repayment Terms and Interest Rates
Rates in 2024 are generally competitive, with some lenders offering rates as low as 4-6%.
Repayment terms typically range from 5 to 10 years, with interest rates varying based on the
businessâ€™s creditworthiness and the lender's policies.
Pros: Long-term cost savings after the loan is repaid.
Ownership of the solar system, allowing businesses to benefit from tax incentives and
depreciation.
Cons: Responsibility for maintenance and repairs falls on the business.
Requires upfront capital or good credit to secure favorable terms.
Solar Leases and PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements)
Structure
In PPA, a third party owns the [rooftop solar](https://www.orbenergy.com/residential-rooftop-solar/). panel system installed on the business property. The
business either leases the equipment for a fixed monthly fee or agrees to purchase the generated
electricity at a predetermined rate (PPA).
Operational Expense vs. Capital Expense Considerations
These options are considered operational expenses, not capital expenses, as the business does not
own the equipment.
Pros:Minimal to no upfront costs.
The third party typically handles maintenance and repairs.
Cons:The business does not own the solar system and thus cannot claim tax incentives.
Long-term savings may be less compared to owning the system outright.
PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) Financing
Unique Repayment Model
Property Assessed Clean Energy financing allows businesses to finance solar energy projects
through their property taxes. Through an annual assessment on the property tax bill the payment
is repaid over a period of up to 20 years.
Eligibility Requirements
As PACE programs are administered at the state and local levels, eligibility varies by location.
The project must meet specific energy-saving criteria and properties must be in a participating
area.
Pros:The assessment may transfer to the new owner if the property is sold.
Long-term, fixed-rate financing with repayment terms.
No upfront costs, making solar power accessible to more businesses.


Cons: Potentially higher overall costs due to interest and administrative fees.
Availability is limited to regions with active PACE programs.
Government Incentives and Tax Credits
Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)
Permitting businesses to deduct 26% of the cost of installing a solar energy system from federal
taxes in 2024, the ITC remains a significant incentive.
Accelerated Depreciation
Reducing taxable income, businesses can also take advantage of accelerated depreciation to
recover the costs of their solar investment more quickly.
